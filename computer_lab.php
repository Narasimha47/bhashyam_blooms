                            Technology has struggled to find its way into the classroom in all sorts of ways, from projectors and televisions to computer labs and student laptops. Along with improving the way students are taught, it is also vitally important that students learn to use computers to improve their own work and prepare for careers in a world where computers have become as common as the pencil and paper.

The Campus is well equipped with air conditioned modern computing facilities for more than 40 students and teachers at a time. Its information technology-based learning solutions, multimedia experience, e-resources and high speed internet connectivity over 10mbps are useful instruments for enlarging the students overall knowledge and perspectives.

While teaching children the importance of mind power, we train them for the effective use of computers to enhance their performance and to optimize their learning potential. We follow the functional approach in computer training which can enliven the subjects and enable the children to explore the concepts in a virtual environment.
