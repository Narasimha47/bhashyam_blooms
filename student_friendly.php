                            Bookish knowledge is not the only purpose of teaching. At Bhashyam Blooms the information is given with the support of visual based learning. The faculty with great care and thought prepares the material for such demonstrations and presentations.

These exercises are aimed to develop the students' presentation skills. Such activities build the confidence of the students, help them analyse the subject and select the core information that the topic conveys. Thereby learning becomes easy to comprehend and easier still to communicate.

                        <p>
                            Bhashyam recognises the importance of preserving the innate curiosity of early childhood throughout the primary years and has evolved with a strong reciprocal learning system that makes the transition from Pre-Primary to Primary Schooling easy.

Research shows that children at this stage can develop a positive attitude to learning if they are given opportunities to use what they already know and relate it to construct a new meaning and understanding.

The scientifically designed Primary School Program provides many experiences of varying ability levels in each of the developmental areas of the child. The specially trained teachers aim to encourage creative thinking, decision making and problem solving, while building on existing theories of the world.

At every step their development is recorded and progress made is monitored.

The Primary section students at Bhashyam CBSE School have the advantage of interactive learning that is visual based. Students are guided to hone their communication and presentation skills from the early stage.

                        <p>
                            Bhashyam firmly believes that learning is comprehensive only when all the senses are put to good use. The level of retention is enhanced and long lasting, if it comes from individual experience.

Field trips provide meaningful and relevant experiential learning opportunities for students to connect the simulated classroom learning to real-world lessons through educational tours and picnics.

These well-planned outing schedules are based on the age groups of the students. During these trips, the students develop a bond and develop inter-personal skills, understand the value of sharing, caring, teamwork, collaboration and coordination. Elaborate security arrangements will be made to ensure the safety of every child during the tours.

Nature is the best teacher. Real world experiences teach the students to face realistic challenges, tackle real life situations and then correlate them with text book learning.
