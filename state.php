                        <p>
                            Bhashyam recognises the importance of preserving the innate curiosity of early childhood throughout the primary years and has evolved with a strong reciprocal learning system that makes the transition from Pre-Primary to Primary Schooling easy. Research shows that children at this stage can develop a positive attitude to learning if they are given opportunities to use what they already know and relate it to construct a new meaning and understanding. The scientifically designed Primary School Program provides many experiences of varying ability levels in each of the developmental areas of the child. The specially trained teachers aim to encourage creative thinking, decision making and problem solving, while building on existing theories of the world. At every step their development is recorded and progress made is monitored.

                        <p>
                            Bhashyam firmly believes that learning is comprehensive only when all the senses are put to good use. The level of retention is enhanced and long lasting, if it comes from individual experience. Field trips provide meaningful and relevant experiential learning opportunities for students to connect the simulated classroom learning to real-world lessons through educational tours and picnics. These well-planned outing schedules are based on the age groups of the students. During these trips, the students develop a bond and develop inter-personal skills, understand the value of sharing, caring, teamwork, collaboration and coordination. Elaborate security arrangements have been made to ensure the safety of every child during the tours.

                            The teaching faculty of the group are good learners, observing the childâ€™s needs, comprehension and assimilation capabilities. Their commitment and dedication together with creative, imaginative and innovative approach make learning inspiring and impressive. To make learning proactive and interactive, teachers make use of a technologically-advanced version of digital boards in the classrooms. These interactive teaching sessions enable the students to pay more attention in the class, while making a dry subject interesting. The teachers demonstrate ample patience and perseverance, while providing emotional support to students, as and when needed. To keep themselves abreast with the developments in the realm of education, they participate in educational workshops, seminars and conferences.
