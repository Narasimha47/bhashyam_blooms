                            Science is essentially a practical subject which emphasizes on experimental work and learning by doing. Experiments carried in our school laboratories are an integral part of the teaching and learning process of the subject. the students are prepared in advance on the theoretical background of the experiments.

Our Science lab is a workplace for the conduct of scientific research. It helps students to remember the concepts better. It helps to transfer the experience to other learning situations. It is a facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific research, experiments and measurement may be performed.

Our science lab consists of Burettes, tongs, tweezers, forceps, test tubes, conical flasks, laboratory balance, specimens, slides, microscopes, many chemicals useful for experiments.

The students are encouraged to test theories prove concepts and validate hypotheses. To substantiate theoretical expressions and to provide sound practical training, the school has separate and full-fledged labs for Physics, Chemistry and Life Sciences
